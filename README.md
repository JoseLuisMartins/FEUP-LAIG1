<h1 align="center">Blockade</h1>

This game was created at Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto, involving two subjects: 
LAIG (Applications with Graphical Interface Laboratory) and PLOG (Logic Programming). 
The goal is to recreate the classic board game "Blockade". The graphical interface was developed using Javascript, 
WebGL and WebCGF, whereas the game's logic was built with Prolog.
